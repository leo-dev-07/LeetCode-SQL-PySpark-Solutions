Use a Queue for every single action in a system (you have single user request and needs a action)

My name is leonardo, I'm 31 years old. I've been working with datawarehouses since 2019.
My most relevant experience regardind this interview was working on a kubernetes cluested hosted on IBM Cloud with pySpark connected to JDBC databases,Bash scripts, 
Salesforce (Salescloud) and Apache Airflow to migrade data to the CRM Salescloud, where we were generating machine learning sales oportunity data inside the Salescloud.
I wonly worked creating the ETL pipelines and making data checks maching the ingested data to our sources and answaring some vendors questions.
Regarding CI/CD I worked with some tools as Helm and Teckton pipeline to add more steps or update old pipelines. I also enhanced some Docker images to add more tools to enhance observability.
